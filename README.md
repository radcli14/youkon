# youkon
YouKon is a multiplatform mobile app used for unit conversions and projects for scientists engineers.
It allows you to group several related parameters, and convert each to a consistent unit system, regardless of the what each system each was originally defined for.
Examples where this may be useful:
- Mass properties and dimensions of an aerospace vehicle
- Density, elastic, and strength properties of a material
- Measurement quantities for a recipe
- ... and many more
